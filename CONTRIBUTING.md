## Contributing to WebTV HD
Want to contribute to the project? Great! There are a few rules you'll need to follow, though.

### Reporting bugs
If you want to report a bug, head on over to our [bug report template](https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-HD/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+) and fill in the blanks. Make sure to provide screenshots and a video, if necessary.

If you need a screen recorder, use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) - it's a little complicated to set up, but it doesn't leave a watermark on your videos. I can't provide a full tutorial here, but there are plenty on YouTube. If you're on iOS, there's a built-in screen recorder accessible from the Control Center.

### Suggesting features
Want to see a feature added to WebTV HD? Fill in our [feature request template](https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-HD/issues/new?assignees=SKCro&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BRequest%5D+). Make sure to clearly describe what you want added - low-effort posts like "plz add x feature" without a clear explanation may not be considered. If your suggestion is unclear, we will ask you to clarify.

### Contributing code
You want to contribute code? That's awesome! Create a fork of the project and make changes to that. When you're done coding, [make a pull request](https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-HD/compare). The only rule is to make sure that your code doesn't clash with mine - I'll need to be able to merge it without too many issues.
